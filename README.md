### Welcome! Here is LycixRemix 👏

I've always considered procrastination to be one's worst enemy, and whenever I make up my mind to do something about it, this damn bad habit always shows up to stop me from acting. As they say, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step". If I can't start, I can't realise what I want to do, so I think I need to get rid of this damn bad habit.

Coding and writing something amusing or useful may be a nice way to spend time ^^, and I hope I can do more in the next few years.
